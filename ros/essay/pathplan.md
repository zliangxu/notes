## 1. exploration transform: a stable exploring algorithm for robots in rescue environments  
**stephan wirth, johannes pellenz**  
**definition**  
a frontier is a cell in the occupancy grid that is marked as free but has a neighboring cell that is marked unknown.

the algorithm calculates a path to the next interesting "frontier"
**exploration**
- frontier-based approach to find the next exploration target.
- an algorithm to find the points in the map from which the sensors can be used optimal to extend the map;


## 2. exploring unknown environments with mobile robots using coverage maps  
**2015, cyrill stachniss, wolfram burgard**  
coverage maps是另一种occupancy grid,每个格子存储着这个地方有障碍的先验概率？感觉不复杂化了问题。

## 3. navigation strategies for exploring indoor environments  
**jean-claude latombe**
Computing a sequence of sensing positions based on data acquired at previous locations is referred to as the next-best-view (NBV) problem. 
## 4. a frontier-based approach for autonomous exploration
frontier: regions on the boundary between open space and unexpected space.
