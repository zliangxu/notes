### what this book is about
```
In 2006, neural network surpass the traditional approaches by deep neural network what we call it today neural network; 
```
### a principle-oriented approach

master a solid understanding of the core principles, such as, program language has syntax, libraries and data structures;
```
### a hands-on approach
