## blocks
keep number of nested blocks to at most 3  
variable property: scope and duration   
Local variables have block scope (they are only visible within the block they are declared), and have automatic duration (they are created at the point of definition and destroyed when the block is exited). 
> Rule: Define variables in the smallest scope possible.

## global variable and linkage
A variable with internal linkage is called an internal variable (or static variable).
